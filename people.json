Scott Sesquicentennial Faculty Fellow, and the Kathy Dwyer Marble and Curt Marble Faculty Director for Energy at the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future. Her research interests lie broadly in the use of systems approaches to enable high penetration of renewable resources and transition to a sustainable energy future. This is an interdisciplinary objective, leveraging operations, optimization, as well as environmental and systems engineering. Prof. Anderson holds field memberships (i.e. supervises graduate students) in Civil and Environmental Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Systems Engineering at Cornell, and an Adjunct appointment in Applied Mathematics at Western University.</p><p>Before coming to Cornell, Anderson was an Assistant Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Western University in Canada.  Dr. Anderson earned her Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Western and a B.S. and M.S. in Environmental Engineering at The University of Guelph (Canada).</p>"},
